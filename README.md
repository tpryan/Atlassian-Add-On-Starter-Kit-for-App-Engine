Sample project that shows how to wire up an App Engine project to serve up an Atlassian Connect Add-on.

Code Samples include 2 applications:

* Hello World - simple demo of how to wire up everything to make a simple JIRA add-on. 
* Langauge Check - spins through your JIRA issues and labels anything that is not in the default language with the language of the issue written out in the default language.

Languages include:

* PHP
* Java
* Python
* Go

For each language there is 2 apps.  Demo is written so that you can run a single add on at time.  All assume that they are going to run on port 8080 of localhost.
